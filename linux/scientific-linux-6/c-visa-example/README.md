C/C++ VISA Example for Linux
============================

Note:

NI VISA for linux only supports 32-bit applications. Make sure gcc 32 bit dev tools are installed. On Scientific Linux/RHEL 6 x64, this can be done with the command:

`sudo yum install glibc-devel.i686 libgcc.i686 libstdc++-devel.i686 ncurses-devel.i686`
